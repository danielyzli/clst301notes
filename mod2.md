# Module 2

## The Basic Components

* Roots
  
   * Multiple roots one meaning: either Greek root and Latin root, or variants from the same language
  
   * Roots with multiple meanings: historically, people started using the root beyond its basic meaning in a more particular fashion, causing a new meaning to form

* Suffixes
  
   * Grammatical suffix: defines the part of speech for the word
  
   * Clinical suffix: provides grammatical structure as well as meaning of its own

* Terminations
  
   * Fossilized form of a root + suffix
  
   * Similar to clinical suffixes, they provide grammatical structure as well as meaning

* Connecting Vowel
  
   * Always "o", only use "i" if instructed to
  
   * Rule #1: use a connecting vowel between all roots
  
   * Rule #2: use a connecting vowel before all suffixes/terminations unless they begin with a vowel or "h"

## Multiple Roots

* Coordinate Roots
  
   * Contribute equal idea to the word
  
   * When defining, keep the meanings in the same order

* Subordinate Roots
  
   * Main root is placed next to suffix/termination
     
      * Subordinate root may be **descriptive** of the main root
        "monodactyly" $\to$ "condition characterized by (the presence of) one digit"
        *mon-* describes the root *dactyl-*
     
      * Subordinate root may indicate the **location** in which an instrument is used
        "ophthalmothermometer" $\to$ "instrument for measuring the heat of the eye"
        *ophthalm-* indicates where *therm-* + *-meter* is used
     
      * Subordinate root may indicate the **source** of something
        "cephalocaudad" $\to$ "moving in a direction from head to tail"
        *cephalo-* indicates where the moving starts
     
      * Subordinate root may indicate the **means by which** some process occurs
        "dactylophasia" $\to$ "speech (conducted through) fingers (i.e. sign lang.)" 
        *dactyl-* indicates how *phas-* happens
     
      * The subordinate root may be the **object** of the root
        "pedohaptophobia" $\to$ "a persistent and irrational fear of touching kids"
        *geront-* provides an object for *hapt-*
     
      * The subordinate root could be the **cause** of a condition
        "syphilodermatopathy" $\to$ "disease of the skin (caused by) syphilis"
        *syphil-* indicates the cause of the *dermat-* + *-pathy*
     
      * The subordinate root may be a **substance** which is present in the root
        "pydermatits" $\to$ "inflammation of the skin (characterized by) pus"
        *py-* is present in *dermat-* + *-itis*

## Brackets

* Square brackets: additional guidelines for when there are multiple options
  
   * For all adjectival and noun-creating suffixes, you will be told which to use; in the absence of such instructions, look for other suffixes/terminations

* Round brackets: supplemental wording i.e. words that appear in the definition but do not appear in the term itself
  
   * Ignore when creating terms

## Defining a Word

* Do not use round brackets; the marker knows what is supplemental

* Alternate definitions are not marked $\to$ avoid using "or" in definitions

## How to Learn and Retain Vocabulary

* Don't use the vocab lists as your only study tool

* Use frequent but shorter study sessions

* Partner up for studying

* Quiz yourself

* Invent your own words and definitions: most important

## Roots: External Anatomy

* *ventr-*
  
   * Latin: *venter, ventris* = "the belly"

* *cervic-, trachel-*
  
   * Note that these can be used to refer to any anatomical neck (e.g. opening of uterus)

* *cheil-, labi-*
  
   * Note that these can be used to refer to any kind of lip (e.g. lip of a bone around a joint)

* *cheir-, chir-*
  
   * Greek: comes from "hand"

* *omphal-*
  
   * Greek: *Omphalos* = "stone navel at Delphi"
  
   * Greeks believed the center of the physical world was Delphi, hence dubbed it the navel of the world

* *thorac-*
  
   * Greek: *thorax* = "breastplate"

## Grammatical Suffixes

* *-ia, -y*
  
   * Note: *-y* is considered a vowel

* Adjectival suffixes in descending order of frequency of use:
  
   * *-ic, -al, -ical, -tic*
  
   * *-ac, -ar, -ary*
  
   * *-eal, -ine, -ous, -ile*

## Clinical Suffixes

* *-osis, -ism, -iasis*
  
   * *-osis* is far more popular and should be default
  
   * *-osis* and *-iasis* have stronger negative or abnormal connotation than *-ism*

* *-ics*
  
   * use the termination *-logy* unless otherwise directed

* *-ous*
  
   * Can be clinical or grammatical suffix depending on context

## Terminations

* *-tomy, ectomy*
  
   * Greek: *-tom* = "cutting"

* *-logical, -logy*
  
   * The word "study" may be omitted based on context (e.g. "pathological" $\to$ "diseased" or "due to a disease")

* *-pathic, -pathy, path-*
  
   * Greek: comes from "feeling, experiencing, or suffering"
  
   * The word "patient" is closely related in that it comes from the Latin word for "feeling, experiencing, or suffering"
