# Module 4

## 2 Things about Terminations

* At minimum, terms are composed of a root + suffix/termination

* Since terminations are root + suffix:
  
   * Terms can be composed of only a prefix + termination (e.g. antiseptic)
  
   * Some terminations can be used entirely on their own (e.g. necrosis, stenosis)

## Anatomical Roots: The Eye and the Ear

* *cor-, core-, pupill-*
  
   * Greek: *cor-, core-* = "doll"
   * Latin: *pupill-* = "doll"
   * Pupil was named "doll" because a small doll-like image of yourself can be seen when looking at someone else's pupil

* *dacry-, lacrim-*
  
   * Both Greek and Latin come from Indo-European *dakru* = "a tear"
  
   * Greek: *upsilon* ($\upsilon$) became English "y" $\rightarrow$ *dacry*
  
   * Latin: "d" became "l" $\rightarrow$ *lacruma* eventually became *lacrima*

* *ir-, irid-*
  
   * Greek: from goddess of the rainbow Iris

* *kerat-, cerat-, cornu-, corne-*
  
   * Greek: *kerat-*, *cerat-* = "horn"
  
   * Latin: *cornu-, corne-* = "horn"
  
   * Cornea of the eye is hard and curved just like animal horn
  
   * English word "horn" comes from Latin *cornu-, corne-*

* *ophthalm-, ocul-*
  
   * Greek: *ophthalm-*; be wary of "ph" in spelling
  
   * Latin: *ocul-*

* *phac-, phac-, lent-*
  
   * Greek: *phac-, phak-* = "lentil"
  
   * Latin: *lent-* = "lentil"

* *scler-, -sclerosis*
  
   * Greek: *skleros* = "hard"

* *cochle-*
  
   * Greek: *cochlea* = "snail"

* *incud-, malle-, staped-, stapedi-*
  
   * Latin: *malleus* = "hammer"
  
   * Latin: *incus* = "anvil"
  
   * Latin: *stapes* = "stirrups"

* *labyrinth-*
  
   * Greek: *labyrinthos* = "labyrinth"
  
   * From the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur
     
      * Theseus, an Athenian prince, volunteered to go to Crete as one of the Minotaur's victims and managed to outwit the Minotaur in the labyrinth with the help of a Cretan princess

## Roots: The Human Being and Senses

* *andr-* vs *anthrop-, hom-, homin-*
  
   * Gendered: *andr-* = "male"
  
   * Genderless: *anthrop-, hom-, homin-* = "human being"

* *hygien-*
  
   * Greek: from the healing deity Hygeia daughter of Asclepius
  
   * The Bowl of Hygeia is the symbol for pharmacists

* *mis-*
  
   * This root is always the subordinate root if there is more than one root

* *necr-, thanat-, mort-, -necrosis*
  
   * Greek: *nekros* = "corpse", contextually "death, dead tissue, dead cells"
  
   * Greek: *thanatos* = "death"
  
   * Latin: *mors, mortis* = "death"
  
   * *-necrosis* can be used to refer to the death of cells, tissues, or whole organs, but not an entire organism
  
   * *necr-* and *-necrosis* have imply unnatural death; *thanat-* and *mort-* carry no such connotations, they just simply mean "death"

* *ped-, paed-*
  
   * Greek: *pais, paidos* = "child"
  
   * Contrast with *ped* meaning foot, coming from Latin: *pes, pedis* = "foot"

* *-acousia, -acousis*
  
   * Greek: note that the English word "acoustic" adds a "t" that's not present here

* *-ectopia, -ectopy*
  
   * Greek: *ec-* + *top-* + *-y, -ia* = "out of place"
  
   * Malposition: object was in wrong spot from beginning; displacement: object was moved to the wrong spot

* *-geusia, -geustia*
  
   * Greek:  comes from "taste"
   * English "gusto" is from Italian and Spanish for "taste", which is derived from the same word as *-geusia, -geustia*

* *-penia*
  
   * Define as "an insufficiency in the amount of something" rather than just "deficiency"

* *-rrhagia, -rrhage, -rrhea*
  
   * Different speeds of discharge: *-rrhagia, -rrhage* is fast, *-rrhea* is slower
  
   * May be spelled with "rr" (British/European) or "r" (American) spellings

* *-rrhapy*
  
   * Linguistically related to "wrap"
  
   * Always spelled with "rr"
