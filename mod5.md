# Module 5

## Writing a Sentence

*Multiple words / short phrases / complex terms will be defined with a sentence*

- Important notes for defining with sentence:
   - Use grammatically accurate, properly punctuated, and idiomatic English
   - Use lay terms (e.g. "brain" instead of "encephalon")
   - The context of the sentence can be made up, as long as the sentence conveys the medical / biological meaning
- Punctuation of prompt:
   - *Terms separated by comma*: treat as unit or separately
   - *Terms not separated by comma*: must treat as unit
