# Module 3

## Prefixes

*Prefixes generally add information about location/position or quality/state*

* Prefix configurations:
  
   * Prefix + Root + Suffix/Termination (Prefix modifies Root)
  
   * Root1 + Prefix + Root2 + Suffix/Termination (Prefix modifies Root2)
  
   * Prefix1 + Root1 + Root2 + Prefix2 + Root3 + ... (Prefix1 modifies Root1 and Root2, Prefix2 modifies Root3)

* Use of prefix with adjectival suffix: be careful whether the prefix already makes the definition an adjective and ignore the adjectival suffix if it does

## The Five Special Prefixes

*a-, dys-, eu-, hyper-, hypo-*

* These 5 prefixes can attach to and modify terminations

* Can also modify termination when attached at the front of the word (particularly true for *hyper-* and *hypo-*)
  
   * However, when creating a word, always assume prefix modifying termination is directly attached to termination

## Prefixes and Connecting Vowels

* A prefix is never followed by a connecting vowel.

* Prefix can be thought of as merging with the root or termination that follows it; whether a connecting vowel precedes should follow root or suffix/termination rules

## Elision and Assimilation

* Elision: prefix ends in vowel and the following root begins with a vowel or "h", option to take out the prefix's vowel (e.g. *hypoalgesia* $\to$ *hypalgesia*)
  
   * You will be specifically instructed to elide; however, you must recognize elided prefixes
   * Unrelated note: when the prefix ends in the same vowel as the following root, it is customary to put a hyphen (e.g. *intra-abdominal*)

* Assimilation: prefix ends in consonant, which is changed for linguistic reasons
  
   * *en-* $\to$ *em-* before "b", "p", "m" (e.g. "embolism", "emphysema")
  
   * *syn-* $\to$ *sym-* before "b", "p", "m" (e.g. "symbiotic", "symmetry")
  
   * *con-* $\to$ *co-* before vowel or "h" (e.g. "coagulate", "cohesive")
  
   * *con-* $\to$ *col-* before "l" (e.g. "collateral")
  
   * *con-* $\to$ *com-* before "b", "p", "m" (e.g. "commensal", "compassion")
  
   * *con-* $\to$ *cor-* before "r" (e.g. "correct", "correspond")
  
   * Must use and recognize without prompting

## Singulars and Plurals

* Pluralizing a root should be done with common sense (e.g. *misopaedia* = "an aversion to children" instead of "an aversion to a child")

* Suffixes/terminations can be pluralized just like English (e.g. biologist $\to$ biologists) with a few exceptions
