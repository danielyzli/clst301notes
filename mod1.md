## Greek and Latin: History

### Earliest Greek Language

* Greek $\subset$ Indo-European

* Earliest evidence of Greek language: "Linear B" writing on clay tablets from <span style="color:blue">15th cen. BC</span> Mycenaean civilization

* Dark Age (<span style="color:blue">12th cen. BC</span> to <span style="color:blue">~800 BC</span>): disappearance of written records; started as Mycenaean civilization collapsed

### The Greek Language and Alphabet

* <span style="color:blue">950-750 BC</span>: Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet:
  
   * For the hard "k" sound: Greek used letter *kappa* ($\kappa$) while Latin used "c"
  
   * Letter "h" did not exist in Greek; considred just a puff of air and often treated like a vowel
  
   * Vowels:
     
      * *upsilon* ($\upsilon$) = "u" but sometimes "y"
      * *iota* ($\iota$) = "i" but sometimes "e"
  
   * Double letter consonants:
     
      * *rho* ($\rho$) = "rh"
     
      * *chi* ($\chi$) = "ch"
     
      * *psi* ($\psi$) = "ps"
     
      * *phi* ($\phi$) = "ph"

### Rise of the Greek City States

* Greek civilizations were organized into self-governing city-states, or *polis*

* Beginning in <span style="color:blue">1000 BC</span> and ramping up in <span style="color:blue">8th cen. BC</span>, Greeks spread throughout the Mediterranean basin: Sicily, southern Italy, southern France, Spain, North Africa, and Black Sea area

* City states fought each other until the Persian Empire invaded Greece in early <span style="color:blue">5th cen. BC</span> and they joined forces under Sparta and Athens

### Greek Classical Period

* The century that followed the Persion Wars is considered the Greek "Golden Age"
  
   * Great tregedians: Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides
  
   * Comic playright Aristophanes
  
   * Architecture: Parthenon on the Acropolis
  
   * Homer: *Iliad* and *Odyssey*

* Peloponnesian War: conflict between the two dominant city-states of Athens and Sparta; won by Sparta

### Age of Philip and Alexander

* Macedonians (Greek-speaking people from Northern part of Greek peninsula), lead by Phillip II forced city-states into an alliance in mid <span style="color:blue">4th cen. BC</span>.

* Phillip planned revenge against the Persians; he was assassinated, but his son Alexander carried out the invasion
  
   * The Greek language was spread far eastwards; became the standard language of commerce and government in many areas

### Hellenistic Period

* Alexander died suddenly after establishing his new empire

* Empire's center of influence shifted from the Greek peninsula to cities such as Alexandria in Egypt and Antioch in Syria
  
   * Advances in medicine (particularly in anatomy)
  
   * Great libraries established in Alexandria and Pergamum (in modern Turkey)

### Earliest Latin Language

- Latin $\subset$ Indo-European

- Earliest evidence of Latin language: inscriptions from <span style="color:blue">6th cen. BC</span>

- Latin alphabet = English alphabet minus letters "j" and "w"

- Rome began as a small, Latin-speaking settlement founded in the <span style="color:blue">8th cen. BC</span>
  
   - Rome grew during the Hellenistic Period and added Hellenistic regions to its own growing empire

### Roman Republic

- Rome was originally ruled by kings, but in early <span style="color:blue">6th cen. BC</span> the Republic (a system based on annually-elected magistrates and representative assemblies) was established

- Rome's expansion spread the Latin language:
  
   - Rome had conquered all of Italy by the <span style="color:blue">3rd cen. BC</span>
  
   - Rome clashed with Carthage in the 3 Punic Wars for control of the western Mediterranean
  
   - Rome absorbed Greece and the Hellenistic kingdoms
  
   - Rome also expanded into North Africa, France, and Spain

### Romain Empire

* Roman Republic system collasped and resulted in frequent bloody civil wars

* In late <span style="color:blue">1st cen. BC</span>, Augustus became emperor

* Geographical linguistic divide - "Latin West" and "Greek East", except:
  
   * Latin was used for law and administration throughtout
  
   * Greek was used for philosophy and medicine throughout

### Greek and Latin After the End of Antiquity

* Romain Empire collapsed in the late <span style="color:blue">5th cen. AD</span>

* During medieval period (<span style="color:blue">5 - 15th cen. AD</span>), Latin was used for all scholarly and ecclesiastical works
  
   * Ecclesiastical Latin continues to be used by the Roman Catholic Church

* In <span style="color:blue">16th cen. AD</span> (Renaissance) there were attempts to revive Classical Latin, which resulted in Neo-Latin
  
   * Neo-Latin was used for science, education, and diplomacy in Europe until gradually repaced by local languages by early <span style="color:blue">18th cen.</span>

* Modern day:
  
   * Latin evolved into modern Romance languages
  
   * Latin is used to name and describe species
  
   * Ancient Greek remains important theologically due to the New Testament
  
   * Ancient Greek serves as the primary source for most medical terminology

## Greek and Roman Medicine

### Important Figures in Greco-Roman Medicine

*All Greeks, no Romans; Romans did not consider bio-medicine worthwhile, while Greeks considered it an extension of philosophy*

* Hippocrates: *father of medicine*
  
   * <span style="color:blue">5th cen. BC</span>; physician and medical writer
  
   * Over 60 medical texts
  
   * Humoral theory; role of lifestyle and environment in inllness

* Plato:
  
   * <span style="color:blue">5th cen. BC</span>; philosopher
  
   * *Timaeus* outlined his conception of the body and soul and their interactions, though internal anatomy and physiology was entirely theorized
  
   * Very respected, his ideas about the human body were valued even though he was not a physician

* Aristotle:
  
   * <span style="color:blue">4th cen. BC</span>; philosopher and Plato's student
  
   * Ideas about human body drew upon analogies from animal dissections; better understanding than Plato, but also sometimes wildly inaccurate
  
   * Promoted empirical investigation of the natural world; first to attempt a systematic classification of the natural world

* Dioscorides:
  
   * <span style="color:blue">1st cen. AD</span>; physician and pharmacologist
  
   * Work on pharmaceutical herbalism *Die Materia Medica* was a standard work of medical reference well into the <span style="color:blue">17th cen.</span>

* Galen:
  
   * <span style="color:blue">2nd cen. AD</span>; physician of the emperor in Rome
  
   * Several hundreds of medical texts
  
   * Held ideas of Hippocrates in very high esteem; modified humoral theory to its modern form
  
   * Often referred to Soranus with great respect

* Soranus:
  
   * <span style="color:blue">2nd cen. AD</span>; physician in Ephesus
  
   * Known for *Gynaecia*: a treatise on gynecology, obstetrics, and paediatrics

### Bio-Medical Theories of the Classical World

* Theories:
  
   * Theory of humours: *most common in ancient world*
     
      * Handed down and relied upon well into the <span style="color:blue">19th cen.</span>
     
      * First recorded by Hippocrates, modified and promoted by Galen
     
      * A person's physical and mental states are determined by the relative ratios of various ($n$) liquids in the body
        
         * According to Galen ($n=4$):
           
            * Blood: hot + wet = Air
           
            * Phlegm: cold + wet = Water
           
            * Yellow bile: hot + dry = Fire
           
            * Black bile: cold + dry = Earth
     
      * Physician's job was to restore balance to the humours
  
   * Pneumatic theory:
     
      * Disorder of the *pneuma* (breath / spirit that was believed to flow in arteries) was the cause of illness
  
   * Corpuscular theory:
     
      * Blockage of *corpuscles* (little bodies that flowed through the body) was the cause of illness

* Sects:
  
   * Dogmatist: *e.g. Hippocrates and Galen*
     
      * Physician should combine theory of disease causation, anatomy knowledge, and understanding of the patient in their practice
  
   * Methodism:
     
      * Understanding human anatomy is unnecessary
     
      * Used corpuscular theory: physician needed only techniques to 'adjust the size of the corpuscular channels to alleviate blockage'
  
   * Empiricist:
     
      * Understanding human anatomy is unnecessary
     
      * Cause of disease was irrelevant; instead detailed notes of what has worked in the past should guide a physician

### Divine Healing

* Hippocratic Oath calls upon various Greek gods of healing

* Galen was a *therapeutes* (servant) in an Asclepion (temple of Asclepius, the Greek god of healing)

### The Continued Use of Greek and Latin in Medicine and Biology

* Greek and Latin elements make up 94% of all life/health science terminology

* Reasons for use:
  
   * Greek and Latin medical terms are well entrenched in history
     
      * Greek was the language of medicine; even during the Roman Empire, medical texts were written in Greek
     
      * Greek medical terms were transliterated (i.e. letter-for-letter) into Latin terms
     
      * After the fall of the Roman Empire, Latin became more prominent in medical texts
  
   * Greek and Classical Latin are dead languages and no longer change
  
   * The word structure of Ancient Greek allows for complex ideas to be made into a single word
